An amendment by Sens Sinema & Tester is designed to ensure a porous border. A wolf in sheep's clothing to  mislead the American people to believe Dems are doing something to secure our borders. It merely provides them cover to vote against my extension of Title 42 protections.
Show this thread
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Sen. Lee's Title 42 amendment wanted a simple majority but Democrats insisted it require 60 votes, so Tester + Sinema proposed a 60 vote amendment instead to meet that demand. It blocks funds that would've ended Title 42 + includes $8.7bil for ""border security & migrant care.""
