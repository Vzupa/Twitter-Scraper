Readers added context they thought people might want to know
Sen. Lee's Title 42 amendment wanted a simple majority but Democrats insisted it require 60 votes, so Tester + Sinema proposed a 60 vote amendment instead to meet that demand. It blocks funds that would've ended Title 42 + includes $8.7bil for ""border security & migrant care.""
